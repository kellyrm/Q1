oh, to execute commands on the server, look at the quake\ctf\d.cfg file.  it's my cfg file.  you'll probably want to start with that to get all the Quake foo-foo stuff taken out (bobbing when running, screen tilt when u get shot, etc).  the rcon_password is airplane.

to exec commands on the server, first:
> exec shirt.cfg
> rcon map ctf2m1
> rcon map dk_50   [this is the one we always play that krunch designed]
> rcon serverinfo
> rcon say hubba bubba ding dong
> rcon status
> rcon kick [userid]

connect blondage.org
