Description          : I originally intended to do this level
                       for Zoid's CTF 4.0 level pack.  However,
                       as the deadline closed in I decided to
                       forego submitting in favour of doing a
                       quality job.

                       And that's what you have in your hands.

                       Fully de-bugged and tested.  R_speeds
                       crests 500 once (520).  The rest of the
                       map is below 450.

Additional Credits to: Everyone in my clan for the helpful
                       suggestions/moral support that lead
                       to V2.0.

                       The Quake editing community for all
                       the free advice, help, and motivation.

                       id Software, Inc., of course, for being
                       so *damn* cool.

* Play Information *
                       This is a Capture The Flag level.  All
                       design/balancing decisions were made
                       with this in mind.  16 CTF starts.

                       There are deathmatch starts for up to
                       16 players.

                       Note: this level will work best with
                       CTF4.0--no one will be able to stand
                       on the lifts and prevent them from
                       descending.
