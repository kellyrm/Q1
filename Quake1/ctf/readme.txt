Intro
-----

You must install this package to play on servers using the custom ThreeWave
flag models and levels for version 4.0.  

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

READ THESE THOROUGHLY BEFORE INSTALLING

1. Make a directory/folder called "ctf" in your Quake directory.  For example:

	C:\>cd quake
	C:\QUAKE>mkdir ctf

2. Copy the pak0.pak and pak1.pak files from this archive into this new 
   directory called ctf.  DO NOT OVERWRITE YOUR EXISTING PAK0.PAK and
   PAK1.PAK FILE!  
   For example:

   	C:\>copy download\pak0.pak c:\quake\ctf
   	C:\>copy download\pak1.pak c:\quake\ctf

   Note:  if you have a patch such as the CTF bot, or ShredCo's CTF mods
   installed, you may already have a pak1.pak in your ctf subdirectory.  If
   this is so, rename that pak1.pak to pak2.pak so it is not overwritten by
   the pak1.pak that comes with this archive.

3. When running Quake for Internet play on the Custom ThreeWave Servers, you
   must add a -game option.  For example:

   q95 -game ctf

   Make sure you do not have an existing -game option in your q95.bat file.
   Windows 95 users should double check their shortcuts if you use them.
   This is not needed for later versions of QuakeWorld.

4. Connect to a server running ThreeWave CTF in Custom mode.
   You can use a tool such as QuakeSpy to locate servers.  Available at
   http://www.quakespy.com/

If you get an error about a model or map not being found, you installed the 
pak incorrectly.
